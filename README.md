PROJECT DESCRIPTION.
This is a system where a tenant can see vacant rooms and register for the one room they desire, pay rent from their account,
request room maintenance, and see changes made to the room by the management. The landlord can see the occupied rooms and 
monitor payments for each tenant and can manage the tenant requests in coordination with the caretaker.
